# ADC Stylebooks
Trying out some of the infrastructure-as-code features for Citrix ADC.

*Note that it is completely silly to actually create an infrastructure in the cloud like that* - the Azure Builtins for app hosting do a much better job. The reason I'm doing it is to see how this would work in an on-prem environment.

After all I'm going to be setting up the stuff declaratively, this stuff's expensive.

## Set up Azure resources
Create a resource group ADCTestRG .
