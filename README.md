# ADC Stylebooks
Trying out some of the infrastructure-as-code features for Citrix ADC.

I'm not going to be setting up everything declaratively from scratch, life is too short and it wouldn't be realistic anyway. What I want to see is how I can set up something that load balances
with an updatable config.
